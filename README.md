# Devops-POC

## Introduction 

This project contains the source code for the 10th Openclassroom project of the "Architecte logiciel" formation.

**Student: Samantha Deschaepmeester**

Medhead is the fictive company which needs to do a Proof of concept (POC) for its new emergency response system.

## Goals 

The new platform has the following goals:
- Regroup and unit all the actions done by the consortium.
- Avoid risks concerning the need of reserving hospitals bed in emergency cases.
- Platform needs to be available at all time.

The Proof of Concept shows the efficiency of the selected architecture.
In this project, the frontend is published online and accessible (see Links section) and allows you to try the system.
To try the system, you can enter an address and select a speciality to search for nearby hospitals.
